# FIFA-WC-PREDICTOR-BASED-ON-WC-18-MATCHES-

Predicts the semi-finalists of WC 2018, based on results of matches in WC 2018 so far. The model is just based on this WC 2018 and most probably suffers from under-fitting, but it just describes the model to predict the outcome of upcoming matches.

Requirements:
1. Python 2.7/3.5/3.6
2. library support for pandas, sklearn (Anaconda can be installed to facilitate this or can install through pipeline)

run command: 'python predict_semis.py'
